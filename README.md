This is a **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) Tutorial to Object Detection**.

This is the fourth in [a series of tutorials](https://github.com/sgrvinod/Deep-Tutorials-for-PyTorch) I plan to write about _implementing_ cool models on your own with the amazing PyTorch library.

Basic knowledge of PyTorch, convolutional neural networks is assumed.

If you're new to PyTorch, first read [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) and [Learning PyTorch with Examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html).

Questions, suggestions, or corrections can be posted as issues.

I'm using `PyTorch 0.4` in `Python 3.6`.
